# Development & Architectural Rules

> **MANDATORY PREREQUISITE**: Whenever asked to build, modify, or refactor any feature or page in this codebase, you MUST read and strictly adhere to this `rule.md` file first. These rules apply to all agents and contributors working on this codebase.

These rules define the non-negotiable engineering, design, accessibility, and operational standards for the Yekis codebase.

---

## 1. Strict Zero-Emoji & Visual Indicator Policy

- **No Emojis Anywhere**: Never use emoji characters anywhere in the user interface, JSX/TSX files, CSS content, HTML strings, user-facing UI, notification text, Telegram bot messages, system logs, buttons, dialogs, or documentation.
- **Visual Indicators**: Use FontAwesome icons (e.g. `<i className="fa-solid fa-envelope" />`), Lucide icons (`lucide-react`), SVG icons, or Google Material Symbols if an icon is needed. If no icon is needed, use clean plain text.
- **Customer Communications**: All automated receipts, alerts, and bot messages must maintain a professional and clean corporate tone without emoji clutter.

---

## 2. Badges, Indicators & Icon Styling

- **No Background or Border on Indicators & Badges**: All indicators, tags, and status badges (e.g. order status, payment status, discount/savings labels, milestone status, KYC verification) must use **bold colored text only**. No low-opacity background colors, no backgrounds at all, no borders, no padding beyond what is needed for inline flow, and no dot pseudo-elements (`::before`).
  - *Correct*: bold green text for "Delivered" / "Paid" / "Approved", bold red text for "Cancelled" / "Unpaid" / "Rejected", bold highland-gold text for "Save 15%" / "In Escrow".
  - *Wrong*: pill-shaped badge with a light translucent background (e.g., `rgba(x, x, x, 0.12)`) and a colored dot.
- **No Decorative Tag Badges on Section Headings**: Do not place `<Badge>` components or similar decorative tag-style elements beside section or page titles/headings.
  - *Wrong*: `<h2>Receipt Preview <Badge tone="good">Latest Live Transaction</Badge></h2>`
  - *Right*: `<h2>Receipt Preview</h2>` with a descriptive `<p>` below it.
- **No Icon Background Tiles**: Icons render as bare colored glyphs — no rounded background squares, no tinted tiles, and no shadows behind icons (stat icons, dashboard cards, system cards). Clean surface backgrounds with bare icons.

---

## 3. UI/UX, Theming & Aesthetics Standards

- **Brand Palette & Tokens**: Respect the brand palette (`highland-gold`, `obsidian`, `parchment`, `cream`, `forest-green`). Do not hardcode hex colors outside design tokens or Tailwind configuration.
- **Button Roundness**: Use `rounded-lg` for storefront and platform buttons for site-wide visual consistency.
- **Dark Mode & Light Mode Support**: Both Dark Mode (`[data-theme="dark"]` or `.dark`) and Light Mode must be fully supported across the entire application:
  - Never hardcode `#ffffff` card/panel/table backgrounds in dark mode — always use theme CSS variables or theme-aware Tailwind classes (e.g., `var(--card)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--bg-alt)`).
  - Status indicators and table slots must never use colored background tints or thick colored indicator borders — use clean surface backgrounds with bold typography.
- **Theme-Conditional CSS Parity Rule**:
  - Theme-conditional CSS (e.g. `:root[data-theme="dark"] ...`) must only ever change `color`, `background`, `border-color`, `box-shadow`, and `opacity`.
  - Layout and shape properties (`width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `gap`, `display`, `grid`/`flex`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, `border-radius`, position offsets) must be **theme-invariant** — define them once in un-themed base rules.
  - Never remove a border in one theme (`border: 0`); recolor it at the same width instead. See `docs/theme-parity/README.md` for the audit methodology that enforces this.
- **Theme Toggle Placement**: The theme toggle (moon/sun icon) exists only in the primary navigation header/sidebar brand bar. Never add a duplicate theme toggle in the footer or anywhere else on the page.
- **No Intrusive Banners or Comparison Bars**: Do not render trial banners, intrusive popups, or unsolicited comparison bars to end users. Maintain an uncluttered, high-end organic store and digital marketplace aesthetic.
- **Compact Date Range Filters**: All date-range filter inputs (`type="date"`) inside toolbars and filter bars must be wrapped in a flex group with explicit width (e.g., `width: 150px` or `w-[150px]`) on each input to prevent them from stretching full-width:
  ```tsx
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 8 }}>
    <input className="input-field" type="date" style={{ width: 150 }} ... />
    <span className="text-dim">to</span>
    <input className="input-field" type="date" style={{ width: 150 }} ... />
  </div>
  ```
- **Micro-Animations**: Use native CSS transitions or lightweight scroll components (e.g. `ScrollReveal`) for scroll-triggered elements. Avoid unnecessary external heavy JS animation libraries.
- **Telegram Mini App Experience**: The Mini App must feel like a native mobile app:
  - Synchronize with Telegram theme parameters (`themeParams`) for light/dark mode.
  - Integrate native `MainButton`, `BackButton`, and `HapticFeedback`.
  - Auto-expand viewport using `WebApp.expand()` on mount.
  - Enable closing confirmation when the user has items in the cart or active transactions/actions in progress.

## 4. Strict Responsiveness & Mobile Compaction Standards

- **Rule First Workflow**: Read and check `rule.md` before designing or writing any code. Every implementation must conform to responsive standards.
- **Fluid Breakpoints**: Every screen, component, modal, and widget must adapt seamlessly across all standard breakpoints:
  - Mobile Phones: `320px` – `640px` (`sm`)
  - Tablets: `641px` – `1023px` (`md` / `lg`)
  - Laptops & Desktops: `1024px` – `1280px` (`lg` / `xl`)
  - Ultra-wide Displays: `> 1280px` (`2xl`)
- **Mobile Compaction Rules**: Pages must stay dense and usable on phones:
  - **KPI Stats**: Render two per row at `≤ 640px` with compact padding and typography — never one giant card per row. Never set inline `gridTemplateColumns` that defeats responsive CSS.
  - **Page Action Buttons**: Share one row (`flex: 1` or `grid`) at mobile sizes rather than stacking into giant vertical blocks.
  - **Dashboard Tiles**: Stay two-across down to small phones — don't collapse into a single vertical column and don't hide icons to "save space".
  - **Zero Horizontal Overflow**: Never introduce unintentional horizontal scrolling on pages. Viewport roots must maintain `overflow-x: hidden`, flex containers must set `min-w-0`, and long text strings must wrap or truncate gracefully.
  - **Touch-Friendly Hit Targets**: Interactive elements (buttons, menu triggers, inputs, checkboxes, tabs) must have a minimum target size of `44x44px` on touch viewports with comfortable tap padding.
  - **Responsive Modals & Dialogs**: Modals must comfortably fit mobile screens (`max-h-[90vh]` or `max-h-screen`, `overflow-y-auto`, `p-3 sm:p-6`). Mobile action footers must stack buttons full-width (`w-full sm:w-auto`) for thumb accessibility.
  - **Responsive Data Grids & Tables**: Complex tables (orders, stock, customers, analytics, proposals, contracts, milestones) must provide horizontal scroll containers (`overflow-x-auto`) or mobile card layouts so columns never collide or get clipped.
  - **iOS & Mobile Form Zoom Prevention**: Mobile inputs and selects must be legible and formatted (font size at least `14px`–`16px`) to avoid erratic browser auto-zooming on focus.
  - **Collapsible Navigation & Universal Sidepanel Reachability**: Navigation drawers and sidebars must collapse into intuitive mobile drawers with touch-friendly backdrops on screens under `1024px`. Every screen and terminal (including POS terminals and Ops Console workspaces with custom header bars) must feature a visible, accessible hamburger toggle button so staff and users can open the navigation sidepanel on mobile at all times.
  - **POS Terminal & Dual-Pane Mobile Standards**: On viewports `< 1024px`, the POS terminal / split workspaces must provide responsive tab switching between Catalog/List and Current Order/Detail Workspace, a sticky floating order bar showing total count & price, and full-width panels. The right checkout/detail panel must never squish or hide the main catalog/list view on mobile.

---

## 5. Navigation & Reachability

- **Reachability Rule**: Every feature page, report, and admin tool must be reachable from the UI.
- Routes that exist in code but have no navigation entry or button link are considered broken — whenever adding or refactoring a page, ensure navigation entries (sidebar links, tabs, or menus) are also implemented.

---

## 6. Secure-Context Features (Camera & Hardware)

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Camera features (QR/barcode scanning for inventory, order receipts, identity documents, or physical packages) require HTTPS (or localhost).
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ship friendly error messages for camera permission denial or insecure context, and always offer a manual fallback (e.g., typed text input for order numbers, customer IDs, or SKU barcodes).

---

## 7. Print & Document Design

- **Formal Document Layouts**: Printable receipts, invoices, stock manifests, contracts, and daily store/settlement reports must follow a formal layout: dual-tone header, cleanly boxed customer/order/contract info, crisp itemized table, totals calculation, and signature lines where applicable.

---

## 8. Codebase Integrity, Type Safety & Build Verification

- **TypeScript First**: Strict type checking must remain enabled across backend and frontend. Avoid `any` where possible.
- **Typecheck & Build Verification**: Run `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit` in backend, `tsc -b --noEmit` in frontend) and build verification (`vite build` / `npm run build`) to confirm type safety and build success after backend or frontend changes.
- **No Superficial Patches**: Never mask errors by suppressing exceptions, returning dummy fallbacks silently, or removing unit tests.
- **Documentation Preservation**: Maintain all existing comments and JSDoc annotations unless explicitly rewriting logic.
- **Agent Artifact Discipline**: Never use `ArtifactMetadata` when writing or editing project source files (only use it for artifact documents in the assistant brain directory).

---

## 9. Backend Architecture & Async Handlers

- **Layered Architecture**:
  - Route handlers should stay thin and delegate to services.
  - Business logic should live in service modules under `apps/backend/src/modules/*`.
  - Prisma access should be centralized through the shared Prisma client.
- **Async Route Handlers**: Express 4 does not catch unhandled asynchronous rejections. Every async route handler must be wrapped in `asyncHandler` (or an explicit `try/catch` block passing the error to `next(err)`). An unwrapped handler turns any database failure or runtime exception into a hung request or an unhandled process crash.

---

## 10. Database, SQL & Migration Discipline

- **Sequential Codes Are MAX-Based**: Human-facing codes (`ORD-00001`, `REC-00001`, `CUST-00001`, `EXP-00001`, `JOB-00001`, `CON-00001`) must be generated using `MAX(trailing digits) + 1`:
  - Never use `count(*) + 1` — deleting or voiding a record hands that code to the next insert and creates duplicates.
  - Seed scripts must continue numbering from the existing MAX in the table, never restart at 1.
  - Both prefix formats (e.g. `ORD0042` and `ORD-00042`) must parse by extracting digits; never assume fixed character positions.
- **SQL Column Discipline**:
  - Qualify every column when a query has a JOIN: `WHERE o.status = ?`, not `WHERE status = ?` (avoid ambiguity crashes when joined tables share column names like `id`, `created_at`, or `status`).
  - Count/summary side-queries must not reference aliases defined only in the main query — e.g. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE c.id = ?` fails if alias `c` does not exist in the count query.
  - Always verify list endpoints (including their COUNT side-queries and filter variants) against a real database before shipping.
- **Migrations & Seeds**:
  - New migrations get the next unused sequential number in `backend/db/sql/` or timestamped Prisma migration folder. Check the directory first.
  - Migrations must be strictly idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, conditional column/index additions, `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` / `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`).
  - Every schema-changing migration must be applied to the database before release.
  - Seed scripts must be re-runnable: skip existing records and continue code numbering from existing MAX values.
  - Check constraints and ENUMs must cover every value the application inserts.
- **Data Integrity & Schema Safety**:
  - Use Prisma migrations instead of manual raw changes when possible.
  - Preserve relationships and indexes when changing the schema.
  - Avoid destructive changes without a review and backup plan.

## 11. API, Session & Authentication Security

- **Session Security**:
  - Use short-lived JWT tokens (`JWT_EXPIRES_IN=8h` or appropriate lifetime).
  - Implement a 30-minute client-side inactivity timeout for authenticated sessions that silently logs the user out (reset timer on mousemove, keydown, click, scroll) without disruptive warning popups.
  - Handle 401 responses from the API by immediately clearing authentication state and redirecting to login.
- **Schema Verification**: All mutation endpoints (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`) must validate input payloads using Zod schemas in `backend/src/schemas/` or `packages/schemas`.
  - Reject invalid or incomplete payloads early with clear error responses.
  - Prefer explicit error codes over generic failures.
- **Financial & High-Risk Workflows**:
  - Escrow, KYC, and disputes must be audited and reviewed carefully.
  - Do not skip basic logging, state checks, or duplicate-protection logic.
  - Keep transaction state transitions explicit and deterministic.
- **Telegram Authentication**: All incoming Telegram Mini App requests must validate cryptographic `initData` using HMAC-SHA256 with the bot token secret. Never trust client-supplied user IDs without cryptographic signature verification.
- **Historical Value Preservation (COGS / Unit Rates)**: Never overwrite historical `unit_cost` or rate values stored in `order_items`, `contract_milestones`, or historical receipts. Moving Average Cost (MAC) changes must only update `products.unit_cost`, and platform fee/tax rate adjustments apply only prospectively.
- **Idempotency**: Critical write requests (like order placement, escrow funding, milestone release, payout request) should accept `Idempotency-Key` headers to prevent duplicate processing.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: The project root `csp-config.js` (or server CSP configuration) is the single source of truth for CSP headers. Never add inline scripts to `frontend/index.html`.
- **Secret Management**:
  - Never commit secrets or credentials.
  - Read configuration from environment variables.
  - Default to non-production-safe values only for local development.

---

## 12. Telegram Integration Rules

- **Universal Regional Routing**: All orders with `order_type === 'delivery'` (or designated mission-critical alerts) must be sent to `TELEGRAM_DELIVERY_GROUP_ID` regardless of city/region.
- **Customer Linking**: When orders or contracts are created via Telegram Mini App or bot, link `customers.telegram_chat_id` and send instant order confirmation receipts back to the user's private Telegram chat.
- **Staff Verification**: Staff access via Telegram bot must enforce `telegram_username` verification and session binding.

---

## 13. Documentation, Testing & Lifecycle

- **Keep Documentation Updated**:
  - Update the relevant Markdown files in the same change whenever code, configuration, schema, routes, UI, architecture, or workflows change.
  - Add every completed change to `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`.
  - Keep `API.md`, `DATABASE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `WALKTHROUGH.md`, `SETUP.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `COMPLETENESS_CHECKLIST.md` aligned with their areas of ownership.
  - Documentation must distinguish locally verified behavior from mocks, stubs, planned work, and production-ready integrations.
- **Write and Maintain Tests**:
  - Add or update tests when changing behavior.
  - Cover critical paths such as auth, escrow release, and dispute flow.
  - Prefer real behavior tests over brittle mock-only verification.
- **Persistent Agent Instruction**:
  - The persistent agent instruction is stored in `.agents/AGENTS.md`.
